        <h2 id="subtitle">Agatha Christie's 10 Favourite Books<h2>
          <p>"My own ten would certainly vary from time to time because every now and then I re-read an early book for some particular reason, to answer a question that has been asked me perhaps, and then I alter my opinion – sometimes thinking it is much better than I thought it was – or not so good as I had thought. At the moment my own list would possibly be:"</p>
          
 
          <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">And Then There Were None</a></strong> – a difficult technique which was a challenge and so I enjoyed it, and I think dealt with it satisfactorily.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</a></strong> – a general favourite.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">A Murder is Announced</a></strong> – I thought all the characters interesting to write about and felt I knew them quite well by the time the book was finished.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">Murder on the Orient Express</a></strong> – again because it was a new idea for a plot.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">The Thirteen Problems</a></strong> – a good series of stories.</li>            
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">Towards Zero</a></strong> – I found it interesting to work on the idea of people from different places coming towards a murder, instead of starting with the murder and working from that.</li>            
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">Endless Night</a></strong> – my own favourite at present.</li>            
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">Crooked House</a></strong> – I found a study of a certain family interesting to explore.</li>            
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">Ordeal By Innocence</a></strong> – an idea I had had for some time before starting to work upon it.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="#" class="tributeLink">The Moving Finger</a></strong> – which I have re-read lately and enjoyed reading it again, very much.</li>
